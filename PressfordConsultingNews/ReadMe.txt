Hi,

This exercise takes too long, other companies required me to do their coding exerices in shorter timeframe and usually took 1 to 2 hours, 
or do online tests up to 90 minutes.

I've tried to get this done inbetween the above and did what I could to build the requested functionality 
and have spent the 8 hours to write this over the 2 weeks.

This is a standard mvc site, using bootstrap

* You will need to change the config connection string 'NewsEntities'
* and run update-database from package manager console or generate the script (Update-Database -Script -SourceMigration:0)

My work on css and javascript is publically viewable at 
www.cartaxguide.com - angular + custom css
www.cartax.co.uk  - angular + web api + mvc

thanks

Hari
